Austin has been building this from the ground up and we have been nothing but pleased with the progress. Austin is also available to talk if there is an issue or if we have a new idea. We are very excited to continue to work with him and grow this soon to be CRM tool.",

Austin built the entire project for less than a big firm would have charged for a few planning meetings. I'm not a programmer, and I send Austin some simple mock-ups of what I want, and a few days later, there it is working on my site. It's completely straightforward. I strongly recommend Elco to any entrepreneur. My project would still be just an idea if I had not found Austin.",

We've worked together for 3 months so far, and he is capable of anything needed for any project, as he has proven in building our site. Obstacles present themselves often with any project, and we have reached solutions together, which he is able to move on without a problem. For example, rather than integrating Zoom for the video conferencing element of our site, he decide it would save money over time to build our own conferencing software, which he did from scratch. With my mind on things other than the product, I was grateful that he was able to have the vision of the company in mind and the willingness to take care of business. What an asset to any startup!",

Austin managed front end, back end, and database development including integrating third party applications to execute payment processing, reporting, etc. He also managed the publication process onto Apple and Google app stores while being swift in addressing any bugs that have popped up after publishing.
